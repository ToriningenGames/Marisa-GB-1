    The buildings around her bewildered her.
    Marisa had seen them before, but the memory was like but a dream.
    Coming across a vast body of water, wonder overtook her,
    and she took flight.
    After a long, uneventful, journey, Marisa came across a most unusual
    foreign land.
    Yet, their attitudes seemed familiar, or at least friendly.
    She came across a crowd, waiting at an empty stage.
    "Looks like the perfect opportunity!"
    Marisa hopped on stage, in an effort to entertain the crowd.
    Little did she know, this one action would change the rest of her life
